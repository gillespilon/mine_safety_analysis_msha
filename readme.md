# Analysis of MSHA mine violations

## In brevi

The United States Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) "works to prevent death, illness, and injury from mining and promote safe and healthful work places for U.S. miners ([website](https://www.msha.gov/about/mission)).

## Data

MSHA provides data about its activities. these files are updated every Friday afternoon ([website](https://arlweb.msha.gov/opengovernmentdata/ogimsha.asp)). Download the [mines data set](https://arlweb.msha.gov/opengovernmentdata/DataSets/Mines.zip) and the [violations data set](https://arlweb.msha.gov/opengovernmentdata/DataSets/Violations.zip). Do not unzip. 

## Methodology

### Mines data munging

Using the Mines.zip file, a selection of US salt mines is made. This file is considerably smaller (xx rows, yy columns) that the original file (aa rows or more, yy columns). It will be the left table of a join.

### Mines + violations analysis

I will write the methodology for this repository.
